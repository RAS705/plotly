# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Introduction

Roza, a molecular biologist has been asked to study the bacteria found in samples from volunteers navel region. She is working with a company, Improbable Beef, to see if any of the bacteria found in the samples can produce proteins which will taste like beef. 

Roza is producing a a dashboard to allow her team at the lab, the team at Improbable Beef, and the study volunteers all look at the current samples submitted. The dashboard will also report the demographics of the volunteer the sample came from.

The dashboard shows the following:
<ul>
 <li>Demographic information for the study volunteer</li>
 <li>Information about how often the volunteer cleans their bellybutton</li>
 <li>The top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons</li>
 <li>Show all of the bacteria found in the sample</li>
</ul>

## Design of Dashboard

The first part of the dashboard that Roza works on is the demographic panel. this panel will allow someone on the website to select a subject id from the dropdown. The system will read the demographics from that subject and fill in the details in the panel

Once we confirm we can select any subject in the study and show their demographics in the demographics panel. The next step of the project is to find all of the samples that subject has submitted. Once all of those samples have been found, the following results will be produced:

<ul>
 <li>A guage will identify how many times a week the subject washes their bellybutton</li>
 <li>A chart will show the top 10 bacteria producing samples</li>
 <li>A chart will show the bacteria produced by every sample from the subject</li>
</ul>

Once Roza has all of the sample data, she can produce the second part of the dashboard. The final dashboard looks like the following:

Now anyone with access to the dashboard can study the samples provided by the subjects based on different factors.
